# Wolt preassignment summer 2020 (Front-end)

_This is a pre-assignment project for Wolt developer summer positions 2020 built with TypeScript & React_

## Project instructions

Build a web page that shows all fifty restaurants. You can freely decide which fields to utilize from restaurants objects, so no need to put all the data visible. However, please use **at least three** fields.

There are no restrictions on design, so restaurants can be displayed vertically, horizontally, on a grid or however you decide. Aim for clear and responsive design.

In addition of rendering restaurants, create a possibility to sort restaurants alphabetically in ascending **and** descending order, e.g. by adding a _sort_-button on the top of the list.

### Project data

_restaurant.json_ contains fifty restaurants from central Helsinki area. Each object has a set fields providing more information about the restaurant, like _name_, _image_ and _location_.
